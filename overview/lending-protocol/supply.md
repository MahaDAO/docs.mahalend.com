# Supply

### How does borrowing and lending work?

When you supply funds to MahaLend, whether to use them as collateral or as a liquidity provider, you automatically begin earning interest or yield on your funds.

Users who want to become lenders can supply their coins into our protocol-based smart contracts. In return, they will get newly minted tokens native to the protocol. These tokens represent principal and interest in a token form that can be redeemed at any time. The rate of exchange between the native tokens and the tokens deposited is embedded inside the APY (annual percentage yield), i.e., an interest rate determined by the ratio between the supplied and borrowed tokens in a particular market.
