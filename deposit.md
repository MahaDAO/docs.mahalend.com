# Deposit

### How does borrowing and lending work?

Users who want to become lenders can deposit their coins into our protocol-based smart contracts. In return they will get newly minted tokens native to the protocol . These tokens represent principal and interest in token form that can be redeemed at any time. The rate of exchange between the native tokens and the tokens deposited embeds inside the APY (annual percentage yield) i.e. an interest rate determined by the ratio that exists between the supplied and borrowed tokens in a particular market.
