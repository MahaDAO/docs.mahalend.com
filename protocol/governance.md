# Governance

MAHA Governance consists of the proposition and decision-making process for the different risk parameter changes, improvements and incentives that constitute the policies, and upgrades to governance itself. All future decisions governing the protocol will be enacted through this procedure.

The MAHA token empowers holders to collectively act as governors of the protocol by enabling them with the capability to vote and bring forward protocol proposals.&#x20;

MAHA and/or (staked version of MAHA) token holders receive governance powers proportionally to the sum of their balance.

There are initially two powers associated with each governance token:

1\. The **proposal power** that gives access to creating and sustaining a proposal.

2\. The **voting power** which is used to vote for or against existing proposals.

MahaLend proposals go through the same processes as other proposals within the MahaDAO ecosystem. To learn more about how MahaDAO conducts governance and proposals, view the in-depth documentation at [https://docs.mahadao.com/governance/governance-overview](https://docs.mahadao.com/governance/governance-overview).&#x20;
