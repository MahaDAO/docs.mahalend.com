# Viewing your Positions

**There are two sections in the positions page:**

*   **Your position:** This tab will let a user know about the pools they have invested in and other details such as the debt ratio and the profit etc.

    NOTE: The debt ratio needs to always be equal to or less than 100 percent.
*   **All positions:** This page will let you know about all the other pools in which other users have invested in. Here too we have all the details such as debt ratio and the collateral value etc along with the liquidate option.&#x20;

    **NOTE: The liquidate option comes up only when the debt ratio value is equal to or more than 100.**&#x20;

### Add-Remove-Close-Harvest

1. **ADD:** A user can add more collateral or debt to their existing position using the 'add' position.&#x20;
2. **REMOVE:** You can remove some of the collateral or debt that a user has from their existing position.&#x20;
3. **CLOSE:** If a user wants to close their position they can use the 'close' option.&#x20;
4. **HARVEST:** The harvest option lets a user claim some of the profits that they have earned from the pools that they have invested in.&#x20;
